# mines

During a job interview, I was given the challenge: write the function to determine where on a board the mines in a game of minesweeper would be dropped.

I think I did okay with it...... but, again, I wanted the practice, so I went home and wrote it up more formally.

Originally, I drew out the board with just blank spaces and mines. v2 included counts in the nearby spaces.
